## Machine Learning
A repository to hold my ML projects

#### Project 1 - K-Nearest neighbors and clustering
Implemented condensed, edited, and regular k-nearest neighbor methods and tested them on several datasets along with k-means and k-medoids augmented KNN. Results of the experiment can be found in results.txt

#### Project 2 - Feedforward neural network and training
A simple feed forward neural network was implemented with no outside libraries. Several different weight training methods were compared, including backpropagation, genetic algorithm, differential evolution, and particle swarm optimization. Results of the experiment can be found in results.txt
